## 📱 About The Project

**Lumen** is more than just a camera app; it's a personal workspace for digitizing your physical world. Built entirely with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, Lumen leverages on-device Machine Learning to detect edges, correct perspective, and generate high-quality compressed PDFs instantly.

Unlike standard scanner apps, Lumen focuses on **privacy and identity**, offering a personalized dashboard that tracks your digitization journey and storage usage.
